# Sign Book

First of all, I am a forgetful person because I have a lot of plans in my head and as time goes by I can forget great ideas and projects that come to my mind, the purpose of this is that when I find something and something comes to mind, I can take a note of it and put it into practice in the future.

For example, I save a lot of things on the internet because I think it will be useful, but when I look for it later it takes time to find it and that gets in the way.

The working logic is simple, there are 3 different strains in the csv file:
- Name
- Purpose
- Link
as such, just do not touch the csv file or make any changes without the editor.
